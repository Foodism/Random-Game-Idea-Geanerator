# Random-Game-Idea-Geanerator
This is a Random Game Idea generator that I made because I was running out of Ideas, (If you don't know how to code in Python I'll show you how you can add more categories in the TXT provided).

//////////////////////////
1. HOW TO ADD CATEGORIES:/
//////////////////////////
  
  go to the line that says "print" ON LINE 60 (AT BOTTOM)
  go inside of the parentheses and copy this code sample into the end with a space at the beginning:
    
    + ' PROMPT ' + YOURSTANDIN[f / 2 + r / 2]       
    
    YOURSTANDIN should be replaced with the stand in that you're using, LATER (REFER TO CUSTOM CATEGORIES SECTION):
    
  Then you want to enter your Prompt, to do this, replace the feild that says PROMPT, Example -------- ' they don't like to '
                                                                                                       ' the character is  '
                                                                                                       ' they are motivated by '
                                                       
 // CUSTOM CATEGORIES //
 
  First you need to enter 20 words / Phrases that could go at the end of the Prompt that you entered before in the quotations in either of the categories labelled first through     tenth EXAMPLE: 'dance', 'sing', 'live', 'grind' ETCETERRA 
                
  
  After that you should be good to go!
